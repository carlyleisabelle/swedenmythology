In simple terms, this ai2html JavaScript code is a tool that helps convert artwork created in Adobe Illustrator into code (HTML and CSS) that can be used on websites.
Here’s what it’s doing, broken down:
 
1. Reading Your Illustrator File
The script looks at your Illustrator document to understand the layout, images, fonts, colors, and other design elements.
 
2. Setting Rules for Conversion
It has a bunch of settings and rules that determine how your artwork will be converted:
What image formats to use (PNG, JPEG, SVG).
How text should appear (as HTML text or as images).
How responsive the graphic should be (fixed size or dynamic for different screens).

3. Converting Graphics to Web Code
The script translates Illustrator layers, text, and images into web-friendly code:
HTML defines the structure (like where images and text go).
CSS controls the appearance (fonts, colors, spacing).

4. Handling Fonts and Styles
It maps Illustrator fonts to web fonts, ensuring that the text looks similar on websites. It even adjusts for small differences between how text appears in Illustrator versus browsers.
 
5. Saving the Output
Once the conversion is done, the script saves everything into folders:
HTML files to be embedded in web pages.
Image files optimized for fast loading.

6. Error Checking and Warnings
The script checks for common mistakes, like missing fonts or unsaved files, and gives warnings if something might go wrong.
 
Why It’s Useful:
Instead of manually recreating a design for the web, this script automates the process, making it faster and more consistent—especially for complex graphics like charts or maps.
